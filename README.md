## The Story Behind Qubee Games üöÄ

### Inspiration and Vision

Growing up in Ethiopia, I witnessed firsthand how technology could be leveraged to preserve cultural heritage while making education accessible. The Afan Oromo language, despite being spoken by over 35 million people, had very few digital learning resources. This gap inspired me to create Qubee Games during my journey at ALX Africa's Software Engineering program.

My vision was simple yet ambitious: build an educational platform that makes learning Afan Oromo engaging, interactive, and accessible to anyone with a smartphone.

### Technical Challenges and Solutions

#### Clean Architecture Implementation

One of my biggest challenges was implementing Clean Architecture in Flutter. I wanted to create a codebase that was maintainable, testable, and scalable. The solution was to organize the project into three layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: UI components using Provider for state management
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic and use cases
- **Data Layer**: Data sources and repository implementations

This separation allowed me to develop features independently and ensure that business logic wasn't tightly coupled with UI or external data sources.

```dart
// Example of clean architecture in the Hibboo feature
// Domain layer - Use case
class GetHibbooList {
  final HibbooRepository repository;
  GetHibbooList(this.repository);

  Future<List<Hibboo>> call() async {
    return await repository.getHibbooList();
  }
}
```

#### Letter Tracing Algorithm

The QubeeQuest feature required a sophisticated algorithm to track a user's finger movement and calculate how accurately they traced a letter. The solution involved:

1. Breaking down letters into segments
2. Using path sampling to track coverage of each segment
3. Implementing a tolerance system to accommodate different tracing styles

```dart
// Simplified version of the tracing accuracy algorithm
double calculatePathCoverage(Path userPath, Path templatePath) {
  final sampledUserPoints = samplePath(userPath, sampleCount: 100);
  final sampledTemplatePoints = samplePath(templatePath, sampleCount: 100);

  int coveredPoints = 0;
  for (final templatePoint in sampledTemplatePoints) {
    if (isPointCovered(templatePoint, sampledUserPoints, tolerance: 15.0)) {
      coveredPoints++;
    }
  }

  return coveredPoints / sampledTemplatePoints.length;
}
```

This was particularly challenging because it needed to be performant on low-end devices while still providing accurate feedback to users.

#### Lessons Learned

1. **State Management Complexity**: Initially, I used setState() for state management but quickly realized its limitations for complex features. Transitioning to Provider significantly improved code organization but came with its learning curve.

2. **Performance Optimization**: The letter tracing feature initially caused frame drops on older devices. I had to refine the algorithm to use fewer computational resources while maintaining accuracy.

3. **Offline-First Approach**: Learning resources needed to be available offline, which required careful planning of data storage and synchronization strategies.

### Future Enhancements

Qubee Games is just beginning its journey. Future iterations will include:

- **Multiplayer Competitions**: Allow friends to compete in language learning challenges
- **AI-Powered Personalization**: Adapt difficulty based on user learning patterns
- **Expanded Cultural Content**: Add more traditional stories and cultural elements
- **Voice Recognition**: Implement pronunciation practice with feedback

### Personal Reflection

This project pushed me far beyond my comfort zone. As a developer who primarily worked on backend systems, diving into mobile development with Flutter was both exciting and intimidating. There were nights of debugging gesture detectors and days of refactoring provider implementations, but each challenge taught me valuable lessons about software design, user experience, and the impact technology can have on cultural preservation.

Qubee Games represents not just a technical achievement, but a personal mission to use technology for cultural and educational empowerment. While it's still a work in progress, I'm proud of what it's become and excited about where it's going.
